Unit 5 Project - Public API Request
 
In this project, I built an app for a fictional company named Awesome Startup, a company with remote employees from
all over the world, to enable them to share their contact information.

I used a random user generator API (https://ransomuserme/) to grab 12 random employees, followed by parsing the data that I reqested using a JSON object from the API to show 12 random users each time the page is reloaded. The employees are listed in a grid with their images and contact information. When their image is clicked, a modal window opens that reveals additional information about the employee.

My goal was to exceed expectations with this project but I ran out of time. I will come back to complete the requirements later for personal satisfaction.

I added a world background to the body in css and added colors to both the card and modal backgrounds.
I added ID's to the tags for the modal because I was going to use them to add functionality to the next and previous buttons. I added the ability to close the modal out on click of the 'x' button.
